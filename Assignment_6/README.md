## Assignment 6 - Text classification using Deep Learning
**Johanne BW**
__Text classification using Deep Learning__

In this assignment we will see how successfully we can use these kind of models (LR and DL) to classify a specific kind of cultural data - scripts from the TV series Game of Thrones.

The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/albenft/game-of-thrones-script-all-seasons

We are going to see how accurately we can model the relationship between each season and the lines spoken.

NB: We use pretrained GloVe embedding for the assignment and these will be downloaded through the bash schript.

## How to run
**Step 1: Clone repo**
- Open terminal
- Navigate to destination you want the repo
- type the following command

 ```
**step 2: Set up enviroment, download pretrained embeddigs and run program:**
- Navigate to the folder "Assignment_6".
```console
cd cds_language_assignments
cd Assignment_6
```  
- Use the bash script _run_assignment6.sh_ to run the programs, download pretrained embeddigs and set up environment:
