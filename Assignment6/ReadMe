## Assignment 6 - Creating reusable network analysis pipeline
**Johanne BW**

The purpose with this assignment is to make a command-line tool which will take a given dataset and perform simple network analysis. 
In particular, it will build networks based on entities appearing together in the same documents.

- The script should be able to be run from the command line
- It should take any CSV file as an input, as long as that CSV file has a column called "text"
- For any given CSV file, it should create a weighed edgelist of named entities, based on document co-ocurrence. This should be used to create a network visualization, which will be saved in a folder called viz.
- It should also create a data frame showing the degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality for each node. It should save this as a CSV in a folder called output.

## How to run
**Step 1: Clone repo**
- open terminal
- Navigate to destination for repo
- type the following command
 ```console
 git clone 
 ```
**step 2: Run bash script:**
- Navigate to the folder "assignment6".
```console
cd assignment6
```  
- Use the bash script _run-script.sh_ to set up environment and run the script:  
```console
bash run-script.sh
```  
The bash script will print out '....` when it is done running.
